## Tutorial

From the beginning you are in the season. You can cut the grass, which gives you mulch into your inventory.
Place mulch on empty soil. On tiles with placed mulch you can then seed plants. When you want, click the `N`
key to end the season. Now the plants will grow and you can harvest them. The harvested value is printed to the
console. Then go to the next season with `N` key.
